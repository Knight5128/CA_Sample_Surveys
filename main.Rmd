# Project Overview（需要修改完善）
This study aims to conduct an objective analysis of economic well-being among **US citizens** by comparing personal <定语>income levels across different presidential administrations, specifically focusing on the Trump (2016-2020) and Biden (2021-2022) presidencies. Through systematic sampling and statistical analysis of IPUMS USA microdata, we seek to evaluate whether there are significant differences in citizen economic outcomes(i.e. change in personal <定语> income) between these administrative periods.

# Data Source
The sampling population is derived from The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS USA), focusing on three pivotal years:
**2016**: Pre-Trump presidency baseline
**2020**: End of Trump's term
**2022**: Mid-term of Biden's presidency

# Methodology Justification (可以放在最后总结部分)
While our population data from IPUMS USA represents a sample of the total US population, we consider this approach methodologically sound for several reasons:
IPUMS USA employs scientifically rigorous sampling methods that ensure representativeness of the US population
The large sample size and sophisticated sampling design of IPUMS data provides sufficient statistical power
The data undergoes thorough quality control and harmonization processes
The sampling weights provided by IPUMS allow for appropriate population-level inference
This approach is consistent with common practice in social science research using complex survey data

# Research Objectives（需要修改完善）
## Primary Objective:
To assess whether there are statistically significant differences in household income levels between the Trump and Biden administrations
## Secondary Objectives:
To analyze income trends across different demographic groups
To control for external economic factors that might influence income levels
To examine the relationship between policy changes and income variations


# Variables of Interest（需要修改完善）
Primary Variable:
Household income (adjusted for inflation)
2. Control Variables:
Age
Education level
Geographic region
Occupation
Industry sector
Race/ethnicity
Gender
Urban/rural classification
Sampling Design
[To be completed based on your specific sampling methodology]




# Limitations and Considerations（可以放在最后总结部分）（需要扩充）
